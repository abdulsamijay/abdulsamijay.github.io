### Paradigm CTF ?
Paradigm hosted a CTF this year named Paradigm CTF 2022. It is an online competition organized for blockchain devs, smart contract devs & hackers. It was also conducted last year in 2021. This year there were total of 23 challenges & this time around multiple different platforms were a part of this CTF. Including EVM-based, Non-EVM i.e Cairo & solana. There were also multiple difficulty level challenges & some follow-up challneges which depended on solving some other challenges.

### My Journey
I along with my team managed to take down several challaenges that I will explain here. I focused more on the EVM based challenges as I was more familair with solidity & completely ignored non-evm challenges. But, It was brought to my attention that few challenges were `sanity checks` meaning they were very very basic challenges we could have crunched in more challenge points for solving them. Sadly by that time the CTF was over! <br>

### Challenge 1: Random
This was a very simple challenge in which we had to call the the functio solve with a random value number generated by the contract. By simply inspecting the contract we could deduce the number was 4. It helped getting more comfortable with the challenge submission process.

```js
pragma solidity 0.8.15;

contract Random {

    bool public solved = false;

    function _getRandomNumber() internal pure returns (uint256) {   // chosen by fair dice roll.
        return 4;                                                   // guaranteed to be random.
    }
    
    function solve(uint256 guess) public {
        require(guess == _getRandomNumber());
        solved = true;
    }
}
```
